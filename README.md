# Trubar

**This package is currently being designed, developed and documented. In its current state, it is likely NOT YET fit for production.**

A Laravel alternative to WordPress + Sage way of creating websites. Everything but the HTML/CSS/JS part of the website (and business logic) can be created in the admin interface. Plugins and themes are supported.

Inspired in part by [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) and [Wink](https://github.com/writingink/wink).

## Why?

Most web development agencies decide on using WordPress for their client work. The reason for that is simple: most people know how to use it or can learn to interface with it quickly. However, we believe the development experience of developing WordPress websites is lacking. We believe there is a better way.

This is why we have decided to build Trubar on top of Laravel Framework, a PHP framework known for being developer-friendly.

*This package is still in active development, so you might want to [watch](https://github.com/wewowweb/trubar/subscription) the repository to be notified of future changes.*
